# HerbatkaParty

A game I made with radon on TKGameJam 2016.
It's made to be a highly suggestive thingy 
strongly reasembling wario ware and other mini
game aggregating games.

Who did what:

Duobix- code, sound effects, and eatin baguettes.
radon- 3D models, music, and learning how to make italo disco.
